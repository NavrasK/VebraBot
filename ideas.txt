Characters are stored in a separate database (_id = uuid.uuid4().hex, other columns are the same)
Registering adds a value to a table of user ids vs. target character id (default: none)
//register $RESET: unlinks you from your current character
//character: prints your current character (if you have one)
//character list: lists the names and ids of all characters in character table
//character $DELETE [id]: deletes the character with the given id
//character $SET [id]: links your account to the character with the given id
//character $NEW: creates a new character and links it to your account
//name $SET [name]
//harm [=+-][x]
//[stat] $SET [val]
